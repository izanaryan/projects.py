## Repository Structure

All the python projects basic to medium level with the keylogger being the advance one: 

- **Basic Keylogger** — A simple key-logging utility (for educational purpose)  

- **Caesar Cipher Code** & **cesar_cypher (mini)** — Implementations of the Caesar cipher (encryption / decryption)  

- **Crop Recommendation** — A small machine learning / decision‐support script for agricultural crop suggestions  

- **FizzBuzz Game** — Classic FizzBuzz exercise  

- **Hangman Game** — Word guessing game  

- **Python Codes Basic** — Collection of simple Python scripts and exercises  

- **Random Name Generator** & **Random Password Generator** — Utility programs generating names / passwords  

- **Rock_Paper_Scissor** — Implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game  

- **Titanic ML** — A small machine learning project: predicting survival on the Titanic  

- **Treasure Hunt** — Puzzle / game script  

- **Untitled Diagram.drawio** — Diagram / model illustration (for visual notes)

##  Key Projects & Highlights

### Titanic ML  
This is the flagship machine learning project in this repo. It includes:
- Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, feature engineering)  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Prediction pipeline  

### Basic Keylogger  
Demonstrates how keystroke logging works (for learning / experimentation purposes only).

### Games & Utilities  
Small fun programs (Hangman, FizzBuzz, Rock-Paper-Scissor) and utilities (random name / password) to sharpen basic Python skills.
